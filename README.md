Shopping Cart Page Using Javascript Description 
A shopping cart page using Javascript is a web page that allows users to add items to their cart and view the items they have selected for purchase. The page is typically designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with features that make it easy to browse and select items, adjust quantities, and remove items from the cart.
When a user adds an item to their cart, Javascript is used to dynamically update the page and display the item in the cart. The item is typically displayed along with a thumbnail image, the item name, price, and quantity, and a subtotal for the item. Users can typically adjust the quantity of an item by clicking on plus and minus buttons or entering a quantity directly into a text box.

The shopping cart page may also include features for calculating taxes, shipping costs, and discounts, and for applying coupon codes. Javascript can be used to perform these calculations dynamically, updating the total price of the cart as the user makes changes.
Once the user has selected all of the items they want to purchase, they can typically proceed to a checkout page to complete their purchase. The shopping cart page may include a button or link to take the user to the checkout page, along with information about shipping and delivery times, return policies, and other relevant details.
Overall, a shopping cart page using Javascript is designed to provide a smooth and seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to browse and select items with ease and confidence.
